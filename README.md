Various vgg architectures (vgg16, vgg12 and vgg19) and their implementation to predict a regression variable<br>
<br>
## VGG Regressor
* **version 1** - basic implementation of vgg architectures with jupyter notebook
* **version 2** - added the logging functionality
* **version 3** - jupyter notebook is removed and everything is now controlled using an external configuration file. 
Also included a readme file with instructions to setup environment and running the code.

## VGG Classifier
* basic implementation of vgg architectures with jupyter notebook
* removed the top layer of vgg16 architecture and used a custom network
* all the layers of vgg16 architecture are freezed other than the custom layers
